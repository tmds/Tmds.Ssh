    /// The credential specified is used for the Kerberos authentication process. This can either be the same or
    /// different from the username specified through <c>SshClientSettings.UserName</c>. The client settings username
    /// is the target login user the SSH service is meant to run as, whereas the credential is the Kerberos
    /// principal used for authentication. The rules for how a Kerberos principal maps to the target user is defined by
    /// the SSH service itself. For example on Windows the username should be the same but on Linux the mapping can be
    /// done through a <c>.k5login</c> file in the target user's home directory.
    ///
    /// If the credential is <c>null<c>, the Kerberos authentication will be done using a cached ticket.
    /// For Windows, this is the current thread's identity (typically logon user) will be used.
    /// For Unix/Linux, this will use the Kerberos credential cache principal, which may be managed using the
    /// <c>kinit</c> command. If there is no available cache credential, the authentication will fail.
    ///
    /// Credentials can only be delegated if the Kerberos ticket retrieved from the KDC is marked as forwardable.
    /// Windows hosts will always retrieve a forwardable ticket but non-Windows hosts may not. When using an explicit
    /// credential, make sure that 'forwardable = true' is set in the krb5.conf file so that .NET will request a
    /// forwardable ticket required for delegation. When using a cached ticket, make sure that when the ticket was
    /// retrieved it was retrieved with the forwardable flag. If the ticket is not forwardable, the authentication will
    /// still work but the ticket will not be delegated.
