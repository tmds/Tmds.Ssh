# Tmds.Ssh

`Tmds.Ssh` is a modern, managed .NET SSH client library for .NET

## API

The library provides two main client types:

- **[SshClient](xref:Tmds.Ssh.SshClient)** - For connecting to SSH servers to execute remote commands, forward connections, and perform filesystem operations.
- **[SftpClient](xref:Tmds.Ssh.SftpClient)** - For performing filesystem operations on SSH servers using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

The documentation for both types includes examples to help you get started.

See the [API Documentation](api/Tmds.Ssh.yml) for detailed information about all types and members.
